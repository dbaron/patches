Bug 1057231 - Put SMIL/SVG Animation rules in their own level of the cascade.

This is needed so that they can participate in the mechanism for
updating only animation styles to the present time without touching any
other styles.

In theory, this should have been done as part of 996796 or even as part
of prior work on off main thread animations, except that it doesn't seem
possible to have SMIL Animations and CSS Transitions interacting on the
same element and have that element's style out of date, which means it
wasn't necessary for the existing code to update only animation styles.

However, bug 960465 will use this similar mechanism as the new mechanism
for making sure transitions start in a reasonable way (replacing the
mechanism of phases, going from style without animation to style with
animation via nsPresContext::IsProcessingAnimationStyleChange).  This
will require that, for SMIL Animations to continue interacting correctly
with CSS Transitions, that they have their own cascade level so that
they can participate in RestyleManager::UpdateOnlyAnimationStyles.

Additionally, this is needed even sooner, for bug 977991, which needs
(temporarily, until bug 960465 lands) a mechanism for updating the style
attribute style *and* all animation-phase-dependent styles.
