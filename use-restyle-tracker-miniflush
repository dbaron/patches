Bug 960465 patch N - Use a RestyleTracker for the coalescing in the miniflush (animation-only style flush).

This changes the coalescing behavior during the animation-only style
flush in multiple ways:

 (1) It does tree-based coalescing between the style updates required by
     animations and those required by transitions, rather than doing
     animations and transitions separately.

 (2) It does not rebuild the rule tree path for elements with animations
     or transitions that are not throttled.
