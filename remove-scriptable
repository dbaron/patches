Remove [scriptable] annotation from interfaces that don't need it.

Record output using the previous patch into run.out.

cat run.out | grep "^unused int" | sort | uniq | cut -f2 | uniq -c | grep "^\s\+2" | cut -b9-  > /tmp/run-interfaces-to-unscript

Run the following script:
=====
#!/bin/bash

OBJDIR=../obj/firefox-debugopt

FILELIST=$(mktemp)
LINELIST=$(mktemp)

cat /tmp/run-interfaces-to-unscript | while read INTERFACE
do
    grep -l "interface $INTERFACE\> *:" "$OBJDIR/dist/idl/"*.idl > "$FILELIST"
    NUMFILES="$(wc -l "$FILELIST" | cut -d" " -f1)"
    if [ "$NUMFILES" = "1" ]
    then
        FILE=$(head -1 "$FILELIST")
        grep -w "interface $INTERFACE\> *:" "$FILE" > "$LINELIST"
        NUMLINES="$(wc -l "$LINELIST" | cut -d" " -f1)"
        if [ "$NUMLINES" = "1" ]
        then
            vim -e "+/interface $INTERFACE\> *:" "+?scriptable" "+s/scriptable, \?//" "+wq" $FILE
        else
            echo "$INTERFACE failed; $NUMLINES interfaces found in $FILE"
        fi
    else
        echo "$INTERFACE failed; $NUMFILES files found"
    fi
done

"rm" "$FILELIST" "$LINELIST"
