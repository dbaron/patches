 This test manifest format could be used by other harnesses, such as ones
 that do not depend on XUL, or even ones testing other layout engines.
 
 Running Tests
 =============
 
+(If you're not using a DEBUG build, first set browser.dom.window.dump.enabled
+to true (in about:config, in the profile you'll be using to run the tests).
+Create the option as a new boolean if it doesn't exist already. If you skip
+this step you won't get any output in the terminal.)
+
 At some point in the future there will hopefully be a cleaner way to do
 this.  For now, go to your object directory, and run (perhaps using
 MOZ_NO_REMOTE=1 or the -profile <directory> option)
 
 ./firefox -reftest /path/to/srcdir/mozilla/layout/reftests/reftest.list > reftest.out
 
 and then search/grep reftest.out for "UNEXPECTED".
