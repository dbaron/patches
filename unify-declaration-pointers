Bug 1221436 patch 4 - Use the same pointer to store the owning rule and the nsHTMLCSSStyleSheet on css::Declaration, since we never need both.

The pointer to nsHTMLCSSStyleSheet was added in patch 1 (which was
needed before patch 2), but it was only patch 2 that created the
invariant that we'd only have one pointer or the other, and never both.
Thus this needs to be done separately, after patch 1.
