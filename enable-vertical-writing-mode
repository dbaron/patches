 // If WRITING_MODE_VERTICAL_ENABLED is defined, we will attempt to support
 // the vertical writing-mode values; if it is not defined, then
 // WritingMode.IsVertical() will be hard-coded to return false, allowing
 // many conditional branches to be optimized away while we're in the process
 // of transitioning layout to use writing-mode and logical directions, but
 // not yet ready to ship vertical support.

 // It is the caller's responsibility to operate on logical-coordinate objects
 // with matched writing modes. Failure to do so will be a runtime bug; the
 // compiler can't catch it, but in debug mode, we'll throw an assertion.
 // NOTE that in non-debug builds, a writing mode mismatch error will NOT be
 // detected, yet the results will be nonsense (and may lead to further layout
 // failures). Therefore, it is important to test (and fuzz-test) writing-mode
 // support using debug builds.
