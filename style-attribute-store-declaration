Bug 978833 patch 18 - For style attributes, only store a css::Declaration instead of a css::StyleRule.

Now that Declaration implements nsIStyleRule, we don't need the memory
overhead of storing a StyleRule object for style attributes.

We also need to change this prior to patch 19, because the changes in
patch 19 that will allow rules to change (but declarations not) would
otherwise break due to style attribute object merging done by
nsAttrValue::ParseStyleAttribute.
