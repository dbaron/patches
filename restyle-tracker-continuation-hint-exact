Bug 960465 patch N - Fix RestyleTracker to handle restyle hints exactly rather than pessimistically when restyling continuations with varying styles (e.g., spans inside ::first-line or ::first-letter).

This is necessary now because animation-only style flushes need to
update *only* the animation style data and no other style data.  Thus
using the RestyleTracker for animation-only style flushes requires that
we do this.
