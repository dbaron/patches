From: L. David Baron <dbaron@dbaron.org>

Mark the hidden window's root element as overflow:hidden to save a reflow when we determine that scrollbars aren't needed.

This should be a tiny bit faster to load because when we do its initial
reflow, we don't need to initially assume it has scrollbars and then
reflow it again without the scrollbars.
