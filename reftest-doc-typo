       Conditions are JavaScript expressions *without spaces* in them.
       They are evaluated in a sandbox in which a limited set of
       variables are defined.  See the BuildConditionSandbox function in
       layout/tools/reftest.js for details.
 
       Examples of using conditions:
           fails-if(winWidget) == test reference
-          asserts-if(2,cocoaWidget) load crashtest
+          asserts-if(cocoaWidget,2) load crashtest
 
    b. <http>, if present, is one of the strings (sans quotes) "HTTP" or
       "HTTP(..)" or "HTTP(../..)" or "HTTP(../../..)", etc. , indicating that
       the test should be run over an HTTP server because it requires certain
       HTTP headers or a particular HTTP status.  (Don't use this if your test
       doesn't require this functionality, because it unnecessarily slows down
       the test.)
