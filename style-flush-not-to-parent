Don't propagate style flushes to the parent document.

This code was originally added in bug 115352 (gecko-dev commit
c628cca2e59a637176c6d40cae713ebe29492160, 2002-02-05), which predates
the distinction between layout and style flushes, which was introduced
later in bug 144072 (gecko-dev commit
a7bff6ad5be06420538029277d82b469f8225b5c, 2004-05-27).

If my understanding is correct, Chromium doesn't make this optimization
because it doesn't have a distinction between flushing layout and
flushing style (although there appears to be some work towards
introducing one).

TODO: Seems to cause:
  mochitest-3 failure:
     TEST-UNEXPECTED-TIMEOUT | dom/html/test/test_iframe_sandbox_navigation.html | application timed out after 330 seconds with no output
  failure much of the time in 4 tests in reftest-8:
     editor/reftests/824080-2.html == editor/reftests/824080-2-ref.html
     editor/reftests/824080-3.html == editor/reftests/824080-3-ref.html

     editor/reftests/824080-5.html == editor/reftests/824080-5-ref.html
  with differing selection inside the iframe, and sometimes differing active/inactive-ness outside the iframe
  and possibly some WPT failures.
