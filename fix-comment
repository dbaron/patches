+# This script uses addr2line (part of binutils) to process the output of
+# nsTraceRefcnt's Linux stack walking code.  This is useful for two
+# things:
 #  (1) Getting line number information out of

-#  (2) Getting function names out of |nsTraceRefcntImpl::WalkTheStack|'s
-#      output on all builds (where it mostly prints UNKNOWN because only
-#      a handful of symbols are exported from component libraries).
