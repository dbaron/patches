When font size inflation is enabled, horizontal resizes of blocks must cause a full dirty reflow.  (Bug 627842, patch 4)

When font size inflation is enabled, the change in the width of a block
(or anything that returns true in IsContainerForFontSizeInflation) needs
to cause a dirty reflow since it changes the size of text, line-heights,
etc.  This is relatively similar to a classic case of style change
reflow, except that because inflation doesn't affect the intrinsic
sizing codepath, there's no need to invalidate intrinsic sizes.

Note that this makes horizontal resizing a good bit more expensive.
However, font size inflation is targeted at a set of devices
(zoom-and-pan devices) where the main use case for horizontal resizing
needing to be efficient (window resizing) is not present.  It does still
increase the cost of dynamic changes caused by script where a style or
content change in one place causes a resize in another (e.g.,
rebalancing a table).

FIXME: write the patch!
