Bug 944200 followup - Consistently use nscoord_MIN for uninitialized mFloatEdgeIStart/End.  r=mats

This fixes an inconsistency in part 2 (32faa7c639ff), which wrote the
constant for uninitialized in two different ways.

The constructor uses nscoord_MIN for uninitialized, and that's also what
GetFloatEdges tests for, so this should use nscoord_MIN as well.

I believe this is because the review comment in comment 29 was only
partially addressed.

I noticed the difference because it caused broken behavior in a tree
with my patch for bug 1227493, which defines NS_INTRINSIC_WIDTH_UNKNOWN
differently.  Some text was disappearing on github (email and website
on user pages), slack (usernames of private chats in the sidebar), and
twitter (username of user who tweeted a quoted tweet).
