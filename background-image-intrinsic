Fix sizing of background-images that have an intrinsic ratio but no intrinsic dimensions (such as many SVG background-images).  (Bug 597778)

This is a stub patch to remind me that it is needed; it will probably be fixed by Waldo's work in bug 609714.

Needed to help CSS 2.1 meet Proposed Recommendation entrance criteria.
